# ðŸ”Œ APM (Apache Project Manager)

A simple CLI to manage yours Apache projects.

## ðŸª… About

To create some PHP applications, I use Apache configurations for each project instead of using Lamp or something like that. And because of that, it requires some boilerplate configuration for each one, so I do that to help me.

The first version of this application I built using Shell Script, but now I built it with Go because I'm learning it and because I want.
