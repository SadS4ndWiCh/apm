# ðŸ”Œ APM (Apache Project Manager)

An simple CLI to manage yours Apache projects.

## ðŸª… About

To create some PHP applications, I use Apache configurations for each project instead of using Lamp or something like that. And because of that, it requires some boilerplate configuration for each one, so I do that to help me.

The first version of this application I built using Shell Script, but now I built it with Go because I'm learning it and because I want.

## ðŸš€ Features

- [x] Create a new project
- [x] Delete an existing project
- [ ] Start running a project
- [ ] Stop the currently running project
- [ ] Restart the currently running project
