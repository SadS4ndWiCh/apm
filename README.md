# 🔌 APM (Apache Project Manager)

A simple CLI to manage yours Apache projects.

## 🪅 About

To create some PHP applications, I use Apache configurations for each project instead of using Lamp or something like that. And because of that, it requires some boilerplate configuration for each one, so I do that to help me.

The first version of this application I built using Shell Script, but now I built it with Go because I'm learning it and because I want.

## 🚀 Features

- [x] Create a new project
- [x] Delete an existing project
- [x] Start running a project

- [x] List all available projects
  - [x] Show if project is currently running
